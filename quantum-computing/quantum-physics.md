### What's a measurement in Quantum physics?
> A measurement is any process that rules out one or more possible outcomes from having occured.
> Ideally, it will rule out all but one possible outcome.

Simply passing a photon through a calcite crystal doesn't make a quantum measurement. But, if the photon is registered by a detector, then the crystal and detector work together to create a measurement.
