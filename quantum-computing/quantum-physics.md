### What's a Qubit?

A Qubi tis the basic unit of quantum information. It's the quantum version of the classical binary bit physically realized with a two-state device.

A qubit represents a Two-state quantum system. This means that it can exist in any quantum superposition of two independent (physically distinguishable) quantum states. The Hilbert space describing such a system is two-dimensional.

We can use electrons or photons to embody the quantum information. When a Qubit is measured, the outcomes represent a classicasl bit, either 0 or 1.

### What's a Hilber Space?

Space in this context, is a set of vectors, which interact in a certain manner. This is a mathematical construct and not the "space" which we normally understand.

The mathematical concept of a Hilbert space generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. They are typically sequences of complex numbers or functions.

In quantum mechanics for example, a physical system is described by a complex Hilbert space which contains the "wavefunctions" that stand for the possible states of the system.

We call H a Hilbert space if every Cauchy sequence of elements of the space converges to an element in the space.

### What's a measurement in Quantum physics?

In quantum physics, a measurement is the testing or manipulation of a physical system in order to yield a numerical result. 

> A measurement is any process that rules out one or more possible outcomes from having occured.
> Ideally, it will rule out all but one possible outcome.

Simply passing a photon through a calcite crystal doesn't make a quantum measurement. But, if the photon is registered by a detector, then the crystal and detector work together to create a measurement.
