### What's a Qubit?

A Qubi tis the basic unit of quantum information. It's the quantum version of the classical binary bit physically realized with a two-state device.

A qubit represents a Two-state quantum system. This means that it can exist in any quantum superposition of two independent (physically distinguishable) quantum states. The Hilbert space describing such a system is two-dimensional.

We can use electrons or photons to embody the quantum information. When a Qubit is measured, the outcomes represent a classicasl bit, either 0 or 1.

### What's a Hilber Space?

Space in this context, is a set of vectors, which interact in a certain manner. This is a mathematical construct and not the "space" which we normally understand.

The mathematical concept of a Hilbert space generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. They are typically sequences of complex numbers or functions.

In quantum mechanics for example, a physical system is described by a complex Hilbert space which contains the "wavefunctions" that stand for the possible states of the system.

We call H a Hilbert space if every Cauchy sequence of elements of the space converges to an element in the space.

### What's Quantum Coherence?

Quantum coherence is an analogous to coherence in classical computing / classical polaritzation.

> Two components, a and b, of the quantum state, must be stable and not wander.

We can use _coherent superposition_ to describe a combination of two states components that give rise to a particular quantum state.


### What's a measurement in Quantum physics?

In quantum physics, a measurement is the testing or manipulation of a physical system in order to yield a numerical result. 

> A measurement is any process that rules out one or more possible outcomes from having occured.
> Ideally, it will rule out all but one possible outcome.

Simply passing a photon through a calcite crystal doesn't make a quantum measurement. But, if the photon is registered by a detector, then the crystal and detector work together to create a measurement.

### Can arrows ⬈ be used to represent the state of macroscopic objects?
Short answer: No. 

The arrow, which is called __state arrow__, is used to represent the positional states of a qubit in a quantum computer.

The arrow can be used to represent mutually exclusive states of a coin, being 'head' or 'tails', but it's impossible to represent a superposition state of the two.
