# The will to change

Men cannot change if there are no blueprints for change.

> In our rapidly changing society we can count on only two things that will never change. What will never change is the will to change and the fear to change. It is the will to change that motivates us to seek help. It is the fear of change that motivates us to resist the very help we seek.
> -- Harriet Lerner, The Dance of Intimacy

## About men

The author states that she not only did not understand men, she feared them. All that we do not know intensifies our sense of fear and threat.

There is no meaningful attempt to offer ways to resolve these feelings. What does it mean to love men in a patriarchal culture?

> It scares me that more and more women are coming to feel this way, to feel that men as an tire gender are hopeless
> -- Barbara Deming

We have to face the truth of our feelingsas they rise up in us - even when we wish it were not the truth. 
So we have to admit the truth that we sometimes wish our own lovers - fathers, sons, etc - were not there.
But, this truth exists alongside another truth: this wish causes us anguish.

Unless men were also deeply engaged in feminist resistance, yet most women were still expressing no genuine interest in hightlighting discussions of malesness.

I had no words to communicate to the dad who did not listen, who did not seem to care, who did not speak words of tenderness or love. My reconciliation with my father behan with the recognition that I wanted and needed his love. Men cannot love if they are not taught the art of loving.

## Wanted: Men Who Love

Every female wants to be loved by a male. They want to feel the love of their father, grandfather, uncle, brother or male friend.
